				<p>
					StrategiX works on a 6 step process....
				</p>
				
				<h2>Step 1</h2>
				<p>
					Discovering what the client needs, building structure, and understanding
					the designs and developments needed to help reach your goal.
				</p>
				<h2>Step 2</h2>
				<p>
					Planning - building a website requires a solid plan - just like anything else.
					We do this by sitting down with you, building site maps, wire-frames
					and prototypes. This ensures the end goal is understood, and aids in the process.
				</p>
				<h2>Step 3</h2>
				<p>
					Designing - Building a brand presence - representing you via a new image, ensuring
					a positive result for you and your future customers.
				</p>
				<h2>Step 4</h2>
				<p>
					Develop - this is where we start to develop the requirements, showing you
					how the website will start to function via technology such as PHP, HTML, CSS and JS.
				</p>
				<h2>Step 5</h2>
				<p>
					Launching the website - this is where the website is subject to extensive QA
					and testing before being published and handed over. Your site will be optimised and
					fit for purpose across all major browsers.
				</p>
				<h2>Step 6</h2>
				<p>
					Support - we will support you even after the site has gone live - continuing our relationship
					by continuing to ensure that it keeps on top of the current market and leading technologies.
