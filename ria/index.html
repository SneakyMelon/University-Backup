									<h2>What is a Marathon?</h2>
									<p> <!-- Source: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/marathon -->
										A marathon is a long-distance running event with an official distance of 42.195 
										kilometres (26.21875 miles),usually run as a road race. The event was 
										instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides, 
										a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens.

									<h2>History of the Marathon</h2>
									<p><!-- Source: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/marathon -->
										The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the 
										distance did not become standardized until 1921. More than 500 marathons are held
										throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being 
										recreational athletes as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.

										<h2>Training Aims on a weekly basis...</h2>
										<p> <!-- Source: http://www.bupa.co.uk/running/training/training-programmes/beginner-10km/-->
											This programme is designed for a beginner runner who would like to train for a 10km run.
											It will focus on completing the distance comfortably, without a particular emphasis on speed.
										</p>
										<p>
											The programme sets out a schedule of running three times a week on the following days: 
											Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. You can train on different days depending on when you have 
											time, but you should keep the recommended rest days between training.
										</p>
										<p>
											To make the most of this programme, you should be able to run/walk 5km in less than 40 minutes,
											and you may have already completed the beginner 5km programme.
										</p>

										<h3>Training Aims:</h3>
										<p><!-- Sourced: http://www.bupa.co.uk/running/training/training-programmes/beginner-10km/#.modTbl -->
											The first two weeks of this programme are designed to get you into the swing of running. The key to
											improving your fitness is continuous movement. These two weeks aim to get you to a level where you 
											can run efficiently and continuously, as it's important that you reach this level before you increase 
											your distance.
										</p>
										<p>
											Running flat-out won't allow you to develop your fitness in the aerobic way this programme is designed
											for. You should be aiming to run at a perceived effort level of around six to seven
										</p>
										<p>
											Running your first measured mile will probably be easier than you think. Start with five minutes of brisk
											walking to warm up before you get to your start point. Then, when you are ready, start your watch and set
											off round the course. Note your time at the end of the course. Don't forget to do at least five minutes of 
											walking to warm down before having a good stretch.
										</p>
										<p>
											As your fitness improves, you will get faster over the one to two mile distances and this is an excellent
											way to chart your progress. Don't worry if your mile times over longer distances don't show the same improvement. 
											This is because your body will tire over longer distances, so your overall running pace slows to allow you to keep going.
										</p>
										<p>
											During these first few weeks your fitness level may be increasing rapidly and you might still be losing
											excess body fat. Because of this, you may find that you are getting faster - but don't push yourself too
											hard. If you are hitting 10 to 11 minutes per mile over the 5km (three miles) distance, that is a good 
											achievement. You should aim to keep to this pace in training while you build up your mileage by running
											longer distances. This will bring you over the finishing line in just over one hour - a very respectable 
											time for your first 10km event.
